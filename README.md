# barabbas

Barabbas is an open source minimalistic web server, used for file transfer (download; upload).
It supports authentication (client; server), encryption (data transfer), access restriction (client) and file integrity checking (validation).
Works, out of the box, with Python3 on major Linux-based OS distributions.

Story/Idea
----

During an assignment i tested a locked down/hardened system (Windows). Some data was required to be transferred to another system (Linux) for further analysis. Although none of the usual (pentest) file transfer methods were usable, one of the most obvious ways, to transfer files, was not locked down - accessing a controlled web server via a system's client (web browser/CLI).
Once the solution to the problem became obvious on the theoretical level i thought that putting it into practice would be quick and simple (i.e. without any web server configuration hassle). It turned out that none of the pentest tools, i was using/aware of, allowed fast and simple setup of a web server, which supported file upload.
Up to this point, in most HTTP file transfer scenarios, i was using the built-in Python simple web server, which supported (only) file download, (only) cleartext communication and lacked an access restriction functionality. To address all of these issues, I had the idea of "upgrading" this default built-in Python web server, for quite a while. The described event resulted with the motivation and initiative to develop such a tool.

Philosophy
----

The tool was developed according to the following high-level guidelines:
* simple to setup
  * built on top of a robust and widely-used platform (Python3)
  * easy and fast to deploy/install
    * download and run
      * zero dependencies (i.e. must work out of the box with plain Python3)
      * single file
      * must work on default installations of the most widely-used Linux distributions (i.e. without requiring any additional OS configuration changes)
* functionality-wise, straight to the point
  * do (only) one thing (file transfer)
  * additionally, only implement relevant functionalities (i.e. avoid bloat)
* configuration/usage-wise, straightforward, simple, flexible and economic
  * overall, keep any additional typing/configuring on the bare minimum (i.e. take out the monkey work out of the equation, as much as possible)
    * default config - use the most meaningful settings
      * just run the tool (i.e. avoid any extra typing)
    * support simple modification of default values (hardcoding), to (permanently) override them
      * just run the tool, without any arguments (i.e. avoid any extra typing)
    * if/when required, override hardcoded (and/or default) settings, via CLI
      * use short and intuitive switches (i.e. minimize any required typing)
* quality-oriented
  * test all functionalities in typical use-case scenarios
    * anticipate user (mis)behavior and solve issues, caused by it (i.e. (attempt to) avoid (all) related program crashes)
  * make as lightweight as possible
  * make as reliable as possible
  * address all identified security issues
* simple to modify/upgrade
  * make source code easy to understand and follow
    * follow [PEP 8 coding guidelines](https://pep8.org/), as much as possible
      * be consistent throughout the whole code, as much as possible (and where meaningful)
      * put meaningful comments (throughout all code)

Implemented functionalities
----

* [MAIN] file transfer (download; upload)
  * file download functionality, using HTTP GET
  * file upload functionality, using HTTP POST (```Multipart/form-data```)
  * interaction with file download/upload functionalities via both CLI and GUI (Windows; Linux)
    * drag and drop via GUI (file upload; Browse button)
* [OPTIONAL] authentication
  * client authentication via HTTP Basic Access authentication
  * web server authentication via server-side X.509 certificate
* [OPTIONAL] (communication channel) encryption/data integrity
  * handled by (Python3) TLS v1.2 + server-side X.509 certificate
    * uses (only) A grade ciphers
* [OPTIONAL] access restriction
  * implemented at two different layers (OSI reference model)
    * Application layer - restricts access at HTTP level
      * upside - does not change any OS settings
      * downside - allows interaction of unauthenticated clients with server (Python3) via HTTP
        * the reason why an additional restriction layer (i.e. beneath the Application layer; IP layer), was implemented
    * IP layer - restricts access using the ```iptables``` OS utility
      * upside - more secure than the Application layer solution
        * disallows (direct) interaction of unauthenticated clients with server (Python3) via HTTP
      * downside - modifies existing OS settings (firewall rules)
        * although tested for most common "layer 8 misbehavior", it still may be possible to cause unintended damage to the system, by tool misusage (i.e. via program crashes)
    * any combination will work: both enabled (default); one enabled, other disabled; both disabled
* [OPTIONAL] file integrity checks
  * generally, HTTP is not the best/most reliable method to transfer files
    * to provide the ability to validate the outcome of file transfers, file checksums (MD5) have been implemented on the server-side
      * applied to all files, served by the web server
      * applied to the file, successfully uploaded to the server-side (included in the server response)

* NOTE: the following functionalities were taken into consideration, but were not implemented (the current ones serve the tool's purpose; some may be implemented in future release(s)):
  * X.509 client certificates 
    * second factor of client authentication
      * overall, seemed like an overkill (considering the tool's purpose)
      * useful in certain scenarios
      * adds an additional security layer, by disallowing interaction of unauthenticated clients with server (Python3) via HTTP
  * event logging to file (in addition to stdout)
    * overall, seemed like an overkill (considering the tool's purpose)
  * additional HTTP file upload methods
    * POST (```application/x-www-form-urlencoded```)
    * PUT
  * support for additional operating systems (e.g. Windows/Commando VM)

Intended audience
----

This tool is intended to be primarily used for penetration testing/red teaming purposes.
I believe that other IT-related professions, that routinely perform file transfers, between various systems (sysadmins/devops/developers), may find it useful, as well as HTB/CTF players/IT security enthusiasts.
Besides those uses, it may also come in handy for everyday computer-related activities (e.g. fast and simple file transfer, between different systems/VMs/containers, in cases where no "proper" file transfer service is installed and a quick (temporary) solution is required).

Intended usage
----

For penetration testing/red teaming purposes, the idea is to start the web server (when required), perform the file upload/download activity, followed by (immediately) stoping the web server, once the file transfer is finished (i.e. start server ➔ dl/ul file(s) ➔ stop server).
In other words, the tool is intended to be used only on demand (i.e. NOT left running in the background, when idle).

DISCLAIMER: **The author of the tool is NOT responsible for any damage, caused by using this tool. Use this tool at your own risk.** The underlying Python3 platform can be interacted with, in certain configurations/scenarios. This may result with execution of arbitrary Python code or external programs, [as stated](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.9/Lib/http/server.py) by its vendor, Python Software Foundation.

Additional remarks/notes:
* **do NOT use** this tool in any **production environment**
* **do NOT leave** this tool **running, when idle**
* **allow access** to the server **only from legitimate client systems** (via the built-in IP layer access restriction functionality), whenever possible
* **enable** the **encryption** functionality (i.e. use HTTPS), whenever possible
* **enable** the **authentication** functionality, whenever possible
  * use random unique strong passwords (e.g. use the built-in random credential generator) 
* this tool was NOT designed for usage over extended time periods
  * may result with stability issues (tool restart required)
* this tool is NOT a full-blown web server
  * will not match the performance of one

Any identified issues/bugs will be addressed/solved, when possible (time-wise).
Based on user feedback, additional features may be implemented, via new releases.
